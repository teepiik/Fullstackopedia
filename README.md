## Description
Fullstackopedia is game project for practising full stack programmer knowledge. There is two different modules. In first module you simply get random questions and after answering them in your head you can reveal correct answer. The other, more game-like module is my version of the popular "Who wants to be a millionaire?" gameshow. Fullstackopedia's version is called "Who wants to be a full stack developer?" and questions are themed accordingly.

## Who wants to be a full stack developer?
